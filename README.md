# DSA210-Project
Sabanci University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project.
This project will be an analysis on my own youtube history.

# Idea, Motivation and Prediction 

  Idea: To analyze the change of music-video rates according to periods by analyzing my Youtube history.
  
  Motivation: I use YouTube as a means of listening to music. I also use YouTube to watch videos in addition to listening to music.
  I usually listen to music while working on something. These are studying, working on a project, doing homework, etc. Therefore, I want to analyze it to see the music-video ratio between the period when I am busy (exam period, project periods) and the period when I am less busy. 
  
  Prediction: Since most of my time is spent studying before the exams and my free time decreases, I expect the rate of music to increase noticeably before the exams, as well as the rate of videos to decrease, and after the exam, I expect the rate of music to decrease significantly and the rate of videos to increase.
  
# Plan
I will retrieve my YouTube history data via Google Takeout. Then, from this data, I will get the data in the time range I need. Finally, I will find the music-video ratio between the periods when I am busy and the periods when I am less busy.

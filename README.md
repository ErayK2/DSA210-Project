# DSA210-Project
Sabanci University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project.
This project will be an analysis on my own spending habit.

# IDEA
This project will focus on analyzing my expenditures over different periods. I will combine credit card transactions and Soliclub card data (to include cafeteria expenses) for a comprehensive analysis. To make the analysis more understandable, I plan to categorize the expenses into specific groups: cafeteria (food), grocery (local and online markets), subscriptions (e.g., Spotify, Amazon Prime), travel (e.g., flights, trains, metro fares), online shopping, and online food delivery.

# MOTIVATION
The biggest motivation for this project is to understand the impact of exams on my life. I want to see how my spending patterns change during these periods (when I am busier and more stressed) and identify which types of expenses are most affected.

# PREDICTION
I believe that happiness has a significant impact on spending habits. For this reason, I think my expenditures decrease to a minimum, especially 1-2 days before exams, then increase after the exams, and rise even further once the exam period is over. I attribute this to the fact that during stressful and unhappy times, my consumption of meals and snacks tends to decrease. Additionally, since my number of trips off-campus drops significantly during these periods, I expect this to be reflected in my expenses. I'm curious to analyze the extent of these changes.

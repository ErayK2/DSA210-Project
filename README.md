# DSA210-Project
Sabanci University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project.
This project will be an analysis on my own spending habit.

# IDEA
This project will focus on analyzing my expenditures over different periods. I will combine credit card transactions for a comprehensive analysis. To make the analysis more organized and understandable, I plan to separate my expenses into specific and meaningful groups. These categories will include cafeteria (food) to reflect meals purchased on campus, market to cover spending at both local markets and online supermarkets, and subscriptions to services like Spotify, Amazon Prime, and other recurring payments. Additionally, I will analyze travel expenses, which include flights, train tickets, and subway fares, which may fluctuate depending on my schedule and commitments. Other categories will include online shopping, which includes purchases made through e-commerce platforms, and online food delivery, which reflects meals ordered from apps or websites in times when convenience is a priority.
# MOTIVATION
The biggest motivation for this project is to understand the impact of exams on my life. I want to see how my spending patterns change during these periods (when I am busier and more stressed) and identify which types of expenses are most affected.For example, I suspect that certain areas, such as online food or online shopping, may see noticeable changes when I'm busier and more stressed.Additionally, it could help me develop strategies to manage my finances more effectively during high-pressure periods, ensuring that I stay on track with my overall financial goals while maintaining a healthy balance in other aspects of my life.

# PREDICTION
I believe that happiness has a significant impact on spending habits. For this reason, I think my expenditures decrease to a minimum, especially 1-2 days before exams, then increase after the exams, and rise even further once the exam period is over. I attribute this to the fact that during stressful and unhappy times, my consumption of meals and snacks tends to decrease. Additionally, since my number of trips off-campus drops significantly during these periods, I expect this to be reflected in my expenses. I'm curious to analyze the extent of these changes.I am particularly curious to measure the extent of these changes and analyze how closely they correspond to my emotional state at different stages of the exam period. By exploring the relationship between my happiness levels, stress, and spending habits, I hope to gain valuable insight into the psychological factors that influence financial behavior.

# HOW DID I GET THE DATA
I received the credit card statement in Excel from the bank application. To make this Excel file the way I wanted, I used the code from Excel_data_organizing.ipynb, which I also added to github. Thus, I obtained an Excel file that is both more understandable, organized and analyzable.

I only entered the amazon subscription manually in the subscription section, the reason for this was that the subscription looked like shopping and confused it with amazon, which is online shopping. I also manually entered food (cafeteria) data at the end of each day.
